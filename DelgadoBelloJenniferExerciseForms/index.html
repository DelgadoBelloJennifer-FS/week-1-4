            BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan; lit. Bulletproof
            Boy Scouts), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy
            band formed in 2010. The band consists of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM,
            Jimin, V, and Jung Kook, who co-write or co-produce much of their
            material.

          <h2 id="members">NAME</h2>
          <p>
            BTS stands for the Korean phrase Bangtan Sonyeondan (Korean:
            방탄소년단; Hanja: 防彈少年團), which translates literally to
            'Bulletproof Boy Scouts'.[4] According to J-Hope, the name signifies
            the group's desire "to block out stereotypes, criticisms, and
            expectations that aim on adolescents like bullets".[5][6] In Japan,
            they are known as Bōdan Shōnendan (防弾少年団).[7] In July 2017, BTS
            announced that their name would also stand for "Beyond the Scene" as
            part of their new brand identity.[8] This extended the meaning of
            their name to encompass the idea of growth "from a boy to an adult
            who opens the doors that are facing forward".

          <h2 id="history">HISTORY</h2>
          <p>
            BTS was formed in 2010, after
            <em>Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang Si-hyuk</em>
            wanted to form a hip hop group around RM (Kim Nam-joon), an
            underground rapper well known on the music scene in Seoul. At the
            time, physical album sales were on the decline and digital revenues
            were not yet high enough to compensate. Seeing a need for
            diversified income streams, Bang decided to form an idol group
            instead, because of the potential for live concert performances and
            passionate support from fans of such groups. Many trainees refused
            to become part of an idol group, but J-Hope, RM, and Suga remained.
            Bang chose to vary from the usual, highly regimented idol groups and
            create one where the members would be individuals rather than an
            ensemble and free to express themselves. Auditions were held in 2010
            with plans to launch the following year.The band members lived
            together, practicing up to 15 hours a day, and first performed
            before a small crowd of industry insiders in 2013.
          </p>
          <h3>MILITARY SERVICE AND CONTRACT RENWAL</h3>
          <p>
            On September 20, 2023, Hybe confirmed through a press release that
            BTS would renew their exclusive contracts.
            <em
              >The members will sign these agreements sequentially, considering
              their military service, after a board resolution with Big Hit
              Music, solidifying their commitment to future projects starting
              from 2025 onwards.</em
            >
            On September 22, 2023, Suga enlisted as a social worker. RM and V
            enlisted on December 11, 2023, followed by Jimin and Jung Kook on
            December 12.On June 12, 2024, Jin became the first member to
            complete his mandatory military service when he was officially
            discharged; he was followed by J-Hope on October 17, 2024, and by RM
            and V on June 10, 2025.All the members will have completed their
            military terms by the end of June 2025.
          </p>
          <h2>IMPACT</h2>
          <p>
            On April 29, 2019, Time magazine named BTS one of the 100 most
            influential people of the year, labeling them the "Princes of Pop".
            Billboard executive Silvio Pietroluongo compared the group's
            influence to that of the Beatles. MRC Data executive Helena Kosinski
            noted that "although BTS weren't the first to open the doors to
            K-Pop worldwide, they were the first to become mainstream. They
            don't just appeal to young people but also to the 50s and 60s age
            demographic." The first non-English speaking artist to make the
            Global Artist Chart in 2018, BTS was the second best-selling artists
            worldwide across multiple media platforms, second only to Drake. In
            2020, BTS became the first non-western and non-English speaking
            artist to be named IFPI's Global Recording Artist of the Year. In
            South Korea, BTS accounted for 41.9 percent of album sales in the
            first half of 2019, up from their market share of 25.3 percent the
            previous year

          />
          <h2 id="music">MUSIC</h2>
          <p>
            Since their inception, BTS have emphasized hip hop as their musical
            base, largely due to the influence of RM and Suga's background as
            underground rappers; during early visits to the US, the group
            received mentoring from American rappers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bang Si-hyuk previously acknowledged that K-pop as a whole draws
            from black music, and author Crystal S. Anderson stated, "BTS's
            rising popularity in the US represents the continuation of the ways
            that K-pop functions as part of a global R&B tradition." T.K. Park
            and Youngdae Kim of Vulture deemed the track "Outro: Her" from Love
            Yourself: Her as the best example of the group's understanding of
            old-school hip hop, with raps inspired by Chuck D and Tupac and
            jazzy chords from the 1990s to create a classic hip hop sound.
          </p>
          <p>
            The release of "Blood Sweat & Tears" in 2016 accelerated BTS's
            transition from a hip hop to a pop group. Park and Kim noted that
            the song draws from dancehall, reggaeton, and moombahton but opts
            for a "baroque mysticism" rather than the "partylike atmosphere of
            its influences". The group also began incorporating traditional
            Korean elements into their music. For example, their single "Idol"
            (2018) features an adlib from Pansori, a Korean form of operatic
            storytelling, and vocal imitations of the sounds of Korean janggu
            drums.
